The UN has recommended 36 changes to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators. This was one of the findings of the UN's [2020 Comprehensive Review Process](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comp-rev/). The changes include replacing, deleting, refining or adjusting existing indicators. In a few instances, the review proposed additional indicators. Within these four groups, the breakdown of changes amounts to:

- 14 proposals for replacements of existing indicators
- 8 proposals for revisions of existing indicators
- 8 proposals for additional indicators
- 6 proposals for deleting indicators, including the partial deletion of 4.2.1

[The UN has detailed more information on these proposals](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comprev/UNSC-proposal/).

The ONS' SDG team have begun a project to put in place the required changes to the indicator set. We anticipate that work will be completed at the end of March 2021. We aim to prioritise changes made on the live website, and will then work to fill the new indicator gaps. When complete, you will still be able to access the old indicators and their data in a separate archived area.

Details of changes are in the following tables.
